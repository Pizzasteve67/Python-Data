<ins><b>Data in Python instead of R<b/></ins>

Most of the data science I learnt in uni is in R <br/>
Using this repository to try out the same machine learning models in python instead of R <br/><br/>
While the key steps may be similar, the syntax differences is annoying enough for me to relearn <br/>
the methods in python just to see how it works in python instead of R
